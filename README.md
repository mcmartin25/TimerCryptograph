# TimerCryptograph
The timer-based cipher

A cryptographer without using password, that I suddenly think of

# How do I have this idea?
I get this idea from one of my dream, which showed the approximate interface and functions. 

After I woke up, I tried to remember, create and improve this app.

# How to use

1. Type Estimated number (`Est. Number`) and Jumper Number (`Jumper`).
2. Click `Count Now`.
3. When you think A's value is appropriate, click `Count Next`. 
4. When you think B's value is appropriate, click `Finish`.
5. Click `Unlock` if the result (A-B) is expected, if not, click `Reset`. 

The final result will be displayed in the bottom status.

# Warning!
You can try it.

PS: This app will not lock, harm your computer, or else, but it is ***test-purpose only and not for illegal uses!***

# ... And why you still create it?
When I have a sudden thought, this will an expression, or a demo, so which means this will be a record.
